MEME handling app<br/>
Simple python app to quickly extract .GIF files from all my meme-trash folder into separate subfolder with handling of same-name file error. For error handling app compares width and height of two files. If they are different app adds number of a day at the end of a name and move it. Otherwise it do exactly the same, but both old and new file are moved to additional "Check".<br/>
Known issues:<br/>
1) hardcoded path - maybe fixed in java version ┐(シ)┌
